      <h2>Lesson 1</h2>
<p>This is the first lesson! This is pretty much an introduction</p>
<p>This lesson is so you can get all your apps. If you don't have enough space, please clear some out or just.. bye? I don't know.</p>
    <h4>Gacha</h4>
      <p>First, you're gonna need to download Gacha. I'm using an Apple Device. If you're using an android, this should still work. I wouldn't know.
        Go into you're app downloading well.. app. Mine is App store. Once you get in, type in the search bar 'Gacha'. Once you do that, download
        the Gacha app you prefer the most. I am using Gacha Club but this'll work with Gacha Life and Gachaverse aswell. Then wait for it to finish
        downloading. Once it finishes, go into the app and make sure it works. If it doesn't, delete it or download it again.</p>
    <h4>Kinemaster</h4>
      <p>This is pretty much the same as last time. Go to the App Store or whatever app downloading thing you have. Then, search up 'Kinemaster'.
        Once Kinemaster pops up, click 'Download'. When it finishes downloading, open the app and see if it works. If it doesn't, delete it and
        download it again. If it asks you to sign in, just click the x or cancel. The app will still work.</p>
    <h4>Alight Motion</h4>
      <p>Go to the App Store. Search up 'Alight Motion'. Once it pops up, click Download. When it finishes downloading, click it and see if it works.
        If it doesn't, delete it and download it again. You do not need to sign in. It still works without you signing in.</p>
    <h4>Ibis Paint X</h4>
      <p>Go to the App Store and search up 'Ibis Paint'. Then click Ibis Paint X (or Ibis Paint if you want to use your money). Click 'download' and
        then wait. Once it finishes downloading, go onto the app and see if it works. If it doesn't, delete it and download it again. If it asks you for
        your age, just click 16-??. It'll let you into the app. And no, nothing is bad on the app. It just asks you for your age.</p>
    <h4>Capcut</h4>
      <p>Go to the App Store and search up 'Capcut'. Then click Capcut. Click 'download' and
        then wait. Once it finishes downloading, go onto the app and see if it works. If it doesn't, delete it and download it again.</p>
